# Cypress Testing Project for [Demoblaze](https://www.demoblaze.com/)

## About the Tool

This project is a test automation suite developed using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for the [Demoblaze](https://www.demoblaze.com/) website. The tool is designed to automate the testing of various functionalities on the Demoblaze platform, ensuring a smooth and error-free user experience. 

Cypress is a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework that allows for writing robust and reliable tests. It is highly efficient in handling web applications, providing fast and easy testing with built-in features for time travel, debugging, and real-time reloading.

## How to Setup

To set up the Cypress testing environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:

   git clone https://github.com/VadimNastoyashchy/cypress-aqa-cource

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

    Change your current directory to the project folder

3. **Install Dependencies**

    Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. Then, install the necessary dependencies by running:

    npm install

4. **Install Cypress**

    If Cypress is not already installed globally, you can install it using the command:

    npm install cypress --save-dev

5. **Open Cypress**

    Once all dependencies are installed, open Cypress using:

    npm run test

    This command will open the Cypress Test Runner, allowing you to select and run tests.

## How to run

To execute the test cases in the Cypress project, follow these instructions:

1. **Run Tests in Interactive Mode**

    Open Cypress in interactive mode using:

    npm run test

    Choose a browser of your preference (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox).

    Click on any test from the list to execute it.

2. **Run Tests in Headless Mode**

    You can also run tests directly in the terminal without a GUI, which is faster and useful for CI/CD pipelines:

    npm run test:run
